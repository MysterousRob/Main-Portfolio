                        I was born on November 23, 2003, in Chicago, Illinois, USA, also known as the Windy City. My early childhood was marked by the loss of my mother when I was just three years old. Raised by my grandparents while my father pursued his career in Europe, I grew up in a nurturing environment that balanced both American and Polish cultures. My family hails from Poland, making me Polish-American, and I learned to speak Polish from a young age through Polish school and family interactions.
                        At the age of 14, I moved to Malta to live with my father and attend high school. This move was pivotal, as it not only exposed me to a new culture but also allowed me to improve my Polish language skills through a friendship with a fellow Polish student.
                        When I turned 17, I landed my first job as a runner at a restaurant called Shakinah, where I began my training as a bartender. Discovering a passion for mixology, I pursued formal training at a trade school and eventually became a mixologist at Shakinah. However, seeking better pay, I transitioned to The Hatters Pub. There, I took on more responsibilities, often managing the bar in the absence of the main manager.
                        Encouraged by my father to explore a career in programming, I began teaching myself to code in November 2023. Using platforms like Codecademy, I learned HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, and more. This new path has been both challenging and rewarding, and I continue to develop my skills in the tech field to this day.
                        These experiences have shaped me into a resilient and adaptable individual, blending the rich cultural heritage of my Polish-American background with the technical skills and creativity of both the hospitality and tech industries.
