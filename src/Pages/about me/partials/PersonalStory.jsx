        Personal Story
      </h2>

        I was born on November 23, 2003, in Chicago, Illinois, USA, also known
        as the Windy City. My early childhood was marked by the loss of my
        mother when I was just three years old. Raised by my grandparents while
        my father pursued his career in Europe, I grew up in a nurturing
        environment that balanced both American and Polish cultures. My family
        hails from Poland, making me Polish-American, and I learned to speak
        Polish from a young age through Polish school and family interactions.
        At the age of 14, I moved to Malta to live with my father and attend
        high school. This move was pivotal, as it not only exposed me to a new
        culture but also allowed me to improve my Polish language skills through
        a friendship with a fellow Polish student. When I turned 17, I landed my
        first job as a runner at a restaurant called Shakinah, where I began my
        training as a bartender. Discovering a passion for mixology, I pursued
        formal training at a trade school and eventually became a mixologist at
        Shakinah. However, seeking better pay, I transitioned to The Hatters
        Pub. There, I took on more responsibilities, often managing the bar in
        the absence of the main manager. Encouraged by my father to explore a
        career in programming, I began teaching myself to code in November 2023.
        Using platforms like Codecademy, I learned HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React,
        and more. This new path has been both challenging and rewarding, and I
        continue to develop my skills in the tech field to this day. These
        experiences have shaped me into a resilient and adaptable individual,
        blending the rich cultural heritage of my Polish-American background
        with the technical skills and creativity of both the hospitality and
        tech industries.
