                        <ul className="p-[10px]">

                                <span className="text-black font-bold">Golfing:</span> I enjoy spending time on the golf course, which not only allows me to stay active but also provides a great way to relax and unwind. Golfing helps me improve my concentration and patience, skills that are beneficial in both personal and professional settings.
                            </li>
                            <li className="pl-[150px]">
                                <span className="text-black font-bold">Gaming:</span> Gaming is another passion of mine. It offers a perfect balance of challenge and entertainment, helping me develop strategic thinking and problem-solving skills. Whether itâ€™s a quick game to unwind or a long session with friends, gaming keeps me engaged and sharp.
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                        <p className="pl-[100px] indent-4">
                            Although my list of hobbies may seem short, these activities are integral to my lifestyle and personal growth, contributing significantly to my overall well-being and shaping the person I am today.
